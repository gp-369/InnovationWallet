# InnovationWallet

In short this website, is for a class project. Over the past couple of months, I've been really interested in finance as something close and personal had happened to me regarding finances. I would really like to improve this project over time, but after what I had gone through I decided that I wanted to spread my experience and knowledge on the subject. I didn't want others to feel alone or like there was nothing else they could do if they got themselves into similar situations such as mine. My goal is to teach minorities and young people about the importance of having a positive financial portfolio through accumulating all different types of information into one. Of course my website is still very new and there is much more to do with it but I specifically want to target these 2 communities because A) many minorities such as myself don't recognize harmful cycles and don't know how to break that generational cycle that many of us(not all) grow up learning and B) young people make mistakes! I want to teach about the long-term consequences we can receive if we don't take our personal finances seriously. Of course, everyone knows the importance of money but do we know the importance of the consequences money can bring and not just homelessness but your reputation as a whole as well. My goal is not to shove this information down the throats of anyone but for SOMETHING to be out there when one of us attemps to look for information regarding finances.
